# HWIDSpoofer
Yes, this is HWID spoofer that is changing registry and some other stuff that was wrote on C#, it has sexy design, yeeaaahhh code is not the best and MAYBE there is some better way to write it, so don't be really rude about it, to memorize and restore HWID it is reading and writing txt file that is in C:/HWID.txt, it takes all EAC registry keys (Someone told me that is worked on valorant and he unbanned himself by using that)

**To make changes take place you need to restart your pc (changes are permanent)**
