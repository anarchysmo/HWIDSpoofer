# HWIDSpoofer
OMG i spent a lot of time posting this on github cuz files was not uploaded in a proper way. Anyways...
Yes, this is User Mode HWID spoofer that spoofes registry and volume ID and it was written on C#. 
I fully recoded this thing and now source code looks nice, things are easy to add and delete. Future support included and I have plans to improve this thing. 
Changes are NOT permanent EXCEPT volume ID spoof. 
# How to use? 
1. Place Volumeid.exe in C:/ directory and nowhere else otherwise it will not spoof Volume Id of your disk.

2. Start HWIDSpoofer.exe and click spoof, after couple seconds you will see popup windows that says that everything is nice and restart your PC and if you want to click spoof again cuz sometimes registry keys are recovering after restart
